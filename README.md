# Exercises
My answers to exercises posted on practicepython.org. My answer to exercise 1 is wrote in polish language and the rest are in english.

# Ex1
Exercise 1 done on 16.05.2021. It was the first code I wrote in my life.
The program was meant to ask person of their name and age, then it calculated the year when this person will be 100 years old.
Then it would ask a person to pick a number and it would print the above answer that many times in a line and in separate rows.

# Ex1.mod_LiTka
This is a variation of exercise 1 done on 29.05.2021r. It calculates the exact date (day, month and year) of the 100th birthday of a person with input data.

# Ex2
Exercise 2 done on 16.05.2021. My second adventure with Python and coding. The program asked a person to write a number and checked if this number was even or odd.
Additionaly the program checks if the input number is divisible by 4.
Next the program ask to input two numbers and checks if first input is divisible by second input.

# Ex3
Exercise 3 done on 16.05.2021. Program has a list of numbers. This one was to learn the "if" loop. First part is printing numbers lower than 5. nex two parts are doing the same thing but they make another list with numbers lower than 5. Difference between those two is that Extra 1 is normal "for" loop and Extra 2 is wrote in one line of code. In Extra 3 the user is asked to input a number and program prints numbers from its list lower that input number.

# Ex4
Exercise 4 done on 17.05.2021. In this exercise I had to make a program which calculated and printed all divisors of user input number.

# Ex5
Exercise 5 done on 17.05.2021. Program has two lists. The task is to build a third list containing elements which are both in list a and b. First Extra does the same but for randomly generated lists, and Extra 2 is main task but written in one line of code.

# Ex6
Exercise 6 done on 18.05.2021. It was to make a program which checks if input word (string) is a palyndrome. I also made the same thing but in one line of code. This program is written in polish language.

# Ex7
Exercise 7 done on 18.05.2021. It is a list comprehension exercise. I was tasked to write a one line of code which would take a list and print another one with only even numbers from first list.

# Ex8
Exercise 8 done on 18.05.2021. It is a program which lets two players play a game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissor'. Unfortunately, I still don't know how to hide player input from another player but other than that the program is fully operatable.

# Ex9
Exercise 9 done on 18.05.2021. It is a game of guessing a number 0-9. It has the function of counting number of player guesses and keeping score.

# Ex10
Exercise 10 done on 20.05.2021. It randomly generates two lists and creates third one containing only common elements without duplicates.

# Ex11
Exercise 11 done on 20.05.2021. It checks if user input number is a prime number. Wish I had this program in elementary school.

# Ex12
Exercise 12 done on 20.05.2021. This was a first function definition exercise. I wrote a function which takes first and last element of any list and adds it to another list.

# Ex13
Exercise 13 done on 20.05.2021. This program asks for input number and prints that much Fibonacci numbers.

# Ex14
Exercise 14 done on 21.05.2021. This program is another list comprehension exercise. The program takes first list and makes another one without duplicates. The exercise was to use two different methods to get the same outcome. One was a list comprehension method and the second was using sets.

# Ex15
Exercise 15 done on 21.05.2021. This program takes input of words from user and prints it from last word to first.
