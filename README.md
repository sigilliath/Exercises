# Exercises
My answers to exercises posted on practicepython.org. My answer to exercise 1 is wrote in polish language and the rest are in english.

# Ex1
Exercise 1 done on 16.05.2021. It was the first code I wrote in my life.
The program was meant to ask person of their name and age, then it calculated the year when this person will be 100 years old.
Then it would ask a person to pick a number and it would print the above answer that many times in a line and in separate rows.

# Ex1.mod_LiTka
This is a variation of exercise 1 done on 29.05.2021r. It calculates the exact date (day, month and year) of the 100th birthday of a person with input data.

# Ex2
Exercise 2 done on 16.05.2021. My second adventure with Python and coding. The program asked a person to write a number and checked if this number was even or odd.
Additionaly the program checks if the input number is divisible by 4.
Next the program ask to input two numbers and checks if first input is divisible by second input.

# Ex3
Exercise 3 done on 16.05.2021. Program has a list of numbers. This one was to learn the "if" loop. First part is printing numbers lower than 5. nex two parts are doing the same thing but they make another list with numbers lower than 5. Difference between those two is that Extra 1 is normal "for" loop and Extra 2 is wrote in one line of code. In Extra 3 the user is asked to input a number and program prints numbers from its list lower that input number.

# Ex4
Exercise 4 done on 17.05.2021. In this exercise I had to make a program which calculated and printed all divisors of user input number.

#Ex5
Exercise 5 done on 18.05.2021. Program has two lists. The task is to build a third list containing elements which are both in list a and b. First Extra does the same but for randomly generated lists, and Extra 2 is main task but written in one line of code.

#Ex6
Exercise 6 done on 20.05.2021. It was to make a program which checks if input word (string) is a palyndrome. I also made the same thing but in one line of code. This program is written in polish language.
